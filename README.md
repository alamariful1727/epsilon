## Material-ui

In the project directory, you can run:

`yarn add @material-ui/core`

## Tailwind CSS

In the project directory, you can run:

`yarn add tailwind`

`npx tailwind init tailwind.js --full`

`yarn tw-build` for **development** use only.

## ECharts

I use `echarts` and `echarts-for-react` for chart components.

## Prettier

In the project directory, you can run:

`npx prettier . --write`

Prettify your files.<br/>

`.prettierrc`<br/>
Write your rules here.<br/>

`.prettierignore`<br/>
Add your ignored files or folder path here.<br/>

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn build:tw-css`

@fullhuman/postcss-purgecss, autoprefixer with postcss-cli work for removing all unused css when `process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'` and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**
